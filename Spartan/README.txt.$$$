# Readme for Spartan and Mace MCNP codes
#***************************************

SETUP
Copy the files to Bridgman or your computer.

Requirements:
These codes use MCNP 6.1 and python with numpy
To use these programs on Bridgman make sure to load the appropriate modules:

module use /app/afit/modulefiles/
module add mcnp
module add tools/python3.5.2

In addition, install numpy for yourself using the following command:
python3 -m pip install --user numpy
python3 -m pip install --user matplotlib

Note: if you have module add compilers/gcc4.9.3 in your .bashrc file or manually added it, MCNP will not run correctly on the cluster.
Use the following command to unload this module:
module rm compilers/gcc4.9.3

There are two main files that you will want to run.
1. StartCode.sh
2. Analyze.py

Note that you must have executable rights to these files and others in the folder.  
So, issue the following comamnd WHEN IN THE FOLDER WITH THE CODE:
chmod u+x *

RUNNING THE CODE
StartCode is the main code for taking user input and automatically creating the MCNP input decks, and
then submitting the jobs to your computer or to the cluster.  The output is saved to a user defined folder.

To run the code and save the input and output files to "MyFolder" change to the code directory and give the command:
./StartCode.sh MyFolder

If you get an error message stating containing "/bin/bash^M", then the windows to linux file transfer introduced carriage return
discrepancies.  In the folder with the StartCode.sh file issue the following command 
sed -i 's/^M$//' *
To get the ^M portion, hold down CTRL and press keys v then m.

The subesequent output tells you the MCNP input files are being created and then run.  When the "Run Complete" message appears
you are ready to analyze the data.

NOTE: submitting jobs to the cluster (cluster=1) will submit ALL of the theta and phi angles unless runbatch.sh is modified
Thus, a large number of jobs (612ish) will be submitted.  Be wise in submitting these jobs as they will clog up Bridgman and 
prevent others from using it. Currently only 10 jobs can run at a time resulting in hundreds waiting in the queue.  
Make sure to kill any jobs that you don't want to run (see killruns.sh for basic batch kill script)

ANALYZING THE DATA
As a minimum, you will need to change variable, "MainDir", in Analyze.py to reference the MCNP output folder. 
Some of the other variables will need to be changed if you want to split the spectrum or bins differently.

Example change:
MainDir='./MyFolder'          #Directory with MCNP output (*.o) files

To load the MCNP output, rebin the data, and calculate the DRM and output parameters, use the following command:
python3 Analyze.py

Note that the file Output.inp is created in MainDir containing the calculated performance metrics.  Feel free to modifity this
file with the parameters important to your project.
